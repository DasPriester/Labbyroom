  explanations:
  - The room you are in right now is your hub. This room is permanent and you can
    always return to it. Here you are able to place down objects or furniture.
  - You can now use your basic temporary key to enter other dimensions. There you
    can find all kinds of new recipes and materials. But be warned - connections
    to other dimensions are unstable, so better be careful.
  - To create a temporary room equip your key and move towards a wall. Click the
    LMB to place a door.
